Testing GWT/GWTP application

Legitimate user's credentials: login - user, password - qwerty (you'll see a popup message with this hint if authorization fails).

You can create, edit and delete documents in the directory:

create: you can't create a document with emtpy fields (you'll see a warning message if you try to do that; this one will disappear after the successfull document's creation)

delete: you can't delete a non-selected document  (you'll see a warning message if you try to do that; this one will disappear after the successfull document's deletion)
