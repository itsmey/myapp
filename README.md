Testing GWT/GWTP application

IMPORTANT: you need to have Jace, stax-api, xlxpScanner and xlxpScannerUtils .jar-files to connect FileNet Content Engine server. This files are not mentioned in pom.xml, they were manually added to project in IDE.

You can obtain these files by installing IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine Client. For additional information, see "Developing Applications with IBM FileNet P8 APIs" document.

You can download this free book here: http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247743.html.


You must also have a deployed FileNet Content Engine server and some Object Store in hand. This information is hardcoded for now.
